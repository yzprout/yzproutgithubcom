I'm a London based freelance software developer, passionate about building and improving the web.  I mainly use [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) as a platform, though I have a background in J2EE.  You can see some of the code I've written [on github](http://github.com/tomafro), or some of my [contributions to rails here](http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/tom-ward/commits).  

If you're interested in hiring me (or want to contact me for any other reason) my email is <a href="mailto:tom@popdog.net">tom@popdog.net</a>.
